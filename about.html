<P>What can I say about myself?  I was born in Randolph, VT and was the second of 7 children. My dad was an enterpreneur, small business owner and tought electronics in the St.Johnsbury Trade School.  My mom, stayed home until my baby sister enrolled in school, then went to work as a secretary in the School District offices.
  
  I attended 3rd through High School in St. Johnsbury, then attended Keene State College.
